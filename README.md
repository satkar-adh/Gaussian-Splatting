# Gaussian Splatting Renderer

This project implements **3D Gaussian Splatting** for real-time, high-quality rendering of scenes from multi-view images. It represents scenes as a collection of 3D Gaussians and renders them efficiently without explicit meshes.

## Features
- Real-time novel view synthesis  
- High-quality photorealistic rendering  
- Efficient GPU-based splatting  
- Mesh-free scene representation
